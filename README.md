# basic-python-ebay-clone
This is a project made for my Fundamentals of ICT course in the first semester of my university.
It is basically an extremely crude version of ebay. It does not connect to the internet.

However users on the same system can log in and add products and make bids etc.

The data is all handled with pandas and several csv files, and the the front end was really my first experience with
any kind of gui at all. I used tkinter for that.

In order for the program to work properly the csv files have to be in the same directory as the program itself and there is no executable thus far.

Furthermore there are problems with it considering the data is very vulnerable and the password field does not hide the text.

I have included the code for both the GUI and the terminal version of the project. (We had not intially planned on making such a comprehensive GUI, however, we had time to spare and thought it would be nice to learn something new, which is why there are two versions at all)
