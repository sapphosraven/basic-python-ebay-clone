# basic-python-ebay-clone
This is a project made for my Fundamentals of ICT course.
It is basically an extremely crude version of ebay. It does not connect to the internet.

However users on the same system can log in and add products and make bids etc.

The data is all handled with pandas and a csv file, and the the front end was really my first experience with
any kind of gui at all. I used tkinter for that.
